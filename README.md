# MovingTheNeedleToMentalHealthGame
This is a game into which I put in a lot of hard work to make people aware of mental health awareness, This game is a choice game and the desc has more info in game sadly you need python to run the game.Note: It is pretty complicated running this without a editor

if you want to run with editor I would suggest using py charm, in pycharm make a doc and then get its location and paste all of the files below read me, alternatively just use exact file names and paste the code in the files. if possible leave a comment if you test saying what went well, and what I should improve TY!
